# ProSeq-Convert
Introducing ProSeq-Convert, a versatile Python application developed with PyQt. This tool seamlessly transforms protein sequence codes between 3-letter and 1-letter formats, catering to the needs of bioinformatics research. With an intuitive GUI and efficient algorithmic processing, ProSeq-Convert is optimized to enhance your research experience.

# Instructions
ProSeq-Convert facilitates bidirectional conversion between 3-letter and 1-letter protein sequence codes. If you input a one-letter code, the application will generate the corresponding 3-letter code, separated by hyphens. When entering a 3-letter code, you have the flexibility to use hyphens or omit them. It's important to note that one-letter codes must be in uppercase, whereas 3-letter codes should be in lowercase.

Upon generating the desired output, simply click the "Copy" button to easily duplicate the output text.

# Usage
To utilize this application:
1. Download the "Amino" folder.
2. Within the folder, locate the executable Windows file named "Amino".
3. Run the "Amino" file to initiate the application.
